        Tamil actor Thalapathy Vijay on Friday announced the formation of political party, 'Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam,' stating his commitment to "fundamental political change" with transparent, caste-free, and corruption-free administration.

       The actor made the big announcement after his fan club, Vijay Makkal Iyakkam, gave a nod to the formation of the political party in a meeting held in Chennai last week.

      In a statement issued by the actor, he said, "We are making an application today to the EC to register our party ‘Tamizhaga Vetri Kazhagam’. Our goal is to contest and win the upcoming 2026 assembly elections and bring about the fundamental political change that people want."
